# dechrissen.github.io

My professional webpage, created with Jekyll and its [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

Visit the site [here](https://dechrissen.github.io/).

### Usage

- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) (this should also install Ruby and Bundler, which are necessary)
- `cd` to this directory
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
(If you get an error related to "webrick", run `bundle add webrick` then re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.)

Your site should now be available to preview at http://localhost:4000.
